## Data

The estimates used to plot the primary results are contained in `point_plot_data.csv`.

The raw data used to generate the histograms for ICE values are not available as they contain protected information about the participants (location).

## Plotting

The plotting code to create the figures and the figures themselves are available here. There is additional code commented out that was excluded from the figures because it was added separately by the journal.
